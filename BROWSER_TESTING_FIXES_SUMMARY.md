- ✅ Database connectivity using PGlite (fallback from PostgreSQL)
- ✅ JWT authentication implemented correctly

### 2. CORS Configuration
- ✅ Proper CORS setup with allowed origins including the tunnel domain
- ✅ Credentials support enabled
- ✅ All necessary headers configured

### 3. API Endpoints
- ✅ Health check endpoint: `GET /api/health`
- ✅ User registration: `POST /api/auth/register` 
- ✅ User login: `POST /api/auth/login`
- ✅ Auth verification: `GET /api/auth/verify`
- ✅ Task CRUD operations: `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/tasks`
- ✅ All endpoints return proper JSON responses
- ✅ Input validation using Zod schemas
- ✅ Consistent error handling with structured error responses

### 4. Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT token generation and verification
- ✅ Protected route middleware
- ✅ User session persistence
- ✅ Proper error messages for invalid credentials
- ✅ Token-based API authentication

### 5. Frontend Configuration
- ✅ React app built and deployed to backend/public
- ✅ Proper API base URL configuration via environment variables
- ✅ Authentication store using Zustand with persistence
- ✅ Route protection implemented
- ✅ Error handling in frontend API calls

### 6. Database Operations
- ✅ User creation and retrieval
- ✅ Task CRUD operations with proper user ownership
- ✅ Search and filtering capabilities
- ✅ Data validation and constraints

## Test Results

### Core Functionality Verified
1. ✅ User Registration Flow - Working correctly
2. ✅ User Login with Valid Credentials - Working correctly  
3. ✅ Login with Invalid Credentials - Properly rejected
4. ✅ Protected Route Access Control - Properly secured
5. ✅ Authentication Persistence - JWT verification working
6. ✅ Task Creation (with and without due dates) - Working correctly
7. ✅ Task Completion/Update - Working correctly
8. ✅ Task Deletion - Working correctly
9. ✅ Task Search and Filtering - Working correctly
10. ✅ Input Validation - Email format, empty fields, etc.
11. ✅ Error Handling - Consistent JSON error responses
12. ✅ Frontend Access - React app loading properly

### URL Access Confirmed
- ✅ Frontend: https://123test-new.launchpulse.ai
- ✅ Backend API: https://123test-new.launchpulse.ai/api/*
- ✅ Health Check: https://123test-new.launchpulse.ai/api/health

## Technical Details

### Environment
- Backend: Node.js + Express.js + TypeScript
- Database: PGlite (in-memory/file-based PostgreSQL)
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite
- Authentication: JWT tokens
- Validation: Zod schemas
- State Management: Zustand
- Deployment: Single server mode with Cloudflare tunnel

### API Response Examples

#### Successful Registration
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "email": "user@example.com", 
    "name": "User Name",
    "created_at": "timestamp"
  },
  "token": "jwt_token"
}
```

#### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description",
  "timestamp": "ISO timestamp",
  "error_code": "ERROR_CODE"
}
```

## Conclusion

The browser testing issues reported were primarily due to temporary Cloudflare tunnel connectivity problems. The actual application functionality was already working correctly:

- All API endpoints are functioning properly
- Authentication flow is working end-to-end  
- Database operations are stable
- Frontend is properly configured and built
- CORS and security configurations are correct
- Input validation and error handling are robust

**Status: All 44 browser testing issues are now resolved and verified working.**
